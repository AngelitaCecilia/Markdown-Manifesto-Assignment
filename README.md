Manifesto of How Journalists Work Today

**1. The Internet is different.**

The Internet produces different public fields, different terms of trade, and different cultural skills. The media should adapt their working methods to the reality of today&#39;s technology instead of ignoring or challenging them. Their job is to develop the best forms of journalism based on available technology. This includes new journalistic products and methods.

**2. The Internet is a pocket-sized media empire.**

The Web reorganizes existing media structures by transcending previous boundaries and oligopolies. The publication and dissemination of media content are no longer tied to significant investments. Fortunately, journalism&#39;s self-conception lost its guard function. All that remains is the quality of journalism in which journalism distinguishes itself from mere publication.

**3. The Internet in our society is the Internet.**

Web-based platforms such as social networking, Wikipedia, or YouTube have become a part of everyday life for most people in the western world. They can be accessed through phone or television. If media companies want to continue to exist, they must understand the world of today&#39;s users and embrace their forms of communication. This includes a basic form of social communication: listening and responding, also known as dialogue.

**4. The Internet is a triumph of information.**

Due to inadequate technology, media companies, research centers, public institutions, and other organizations compile and classify the world&#39;s information to date. Nowadays, every citizen can create their own personal news filter, while search engines utilize a wealth of information of unprecedented magnitude. Individuals can now inform themselves better than ever before.

**5. The Internet improves journalism.**

Through the Internet, journalism can fulfill its socio-educational role in new ways. This includes presenting information as an ever-changing and ongoing process; Confiscation of print media helplessness is a benefit. Those who want to survive in this new world of information need new idealism, new journalistic ideas, and a sense of pleasure in exploiting this new potential.

**6. Links reward, citations adorn.**

Search engines and aggregators facilitate quality journalism: they enhance the ability to find content that circulates in the long run and is an integral part of the new networked public space. References through links and quotes — especially those made without the consent or even rewards of the originator — make the social discourse culture of networking possible at first. They are all worth protecting.

**7. The Internet is a new place for political discourse.**

Democracy is increasing in participation and freedom of information. Transferring political discussions from traditional media to the Internet and expanding these discussions by involving the active participation of the public is one of journalism&#39;s new tasks.

**8. More is more – there is not too much information.**

Back then, churches prioritized power over personal consciousness and warned of a flood of information when letterpress was discovered. On the other hand, pamphlets, encyclopedias, and journalists prove that more information leads to more freedom, both for individuals and society. To this day, nothing has changed in this regard.

**9. What&#39;s on the Internet stays on the Internet.**

The Internet took journalism to a new qualitative level. Online, text, sound, and images no longer have to be temporary. They can still be recovered, thereby building an archive of contemporary history. Journalism must consider the development of its information, interpretation, and errors; that is, it must admit its errors and correct them transparently.

**10. Quality remains an essential quality.**

The Internet eliminates homogeneous bulk goods. Only exceptional, credible, and unique will gain a stable following in the long run. User demands are increasing. Journalism must fulfill it and adhere to its principles that are often formulated.
